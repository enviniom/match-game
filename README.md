# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Cloning this project

You just need to clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
# clone this project in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/enviniom/match-game.git

# install dependencies with your package manager, change npm by yours (npm, pnpm, yarn)
npm i
```

## Developing and/or running

Once you've clonned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
